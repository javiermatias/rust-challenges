Rust Challenge Repository
Welcome to my Rust challenge repository! In this project, I will be solving a variety of coding challenges using Rust programming language. The goal of this project is to learn and improve my Rust programming skills through hands-on practice.

How to Use This Repository
Each coding challenge is implemented in its own Rust file with a descriptive file name. The challenges are divided into separate directories based on their difficulty level.

To run the Rust code for a specific challenge, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and run the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
cargo run
The Rust program will execute and output the solution to the challenge.

Challenge Sources
The coding challenges in this repository are sourced from various online platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and Project Euler. Each challenge will include a brief description of the problem statement, input/output examples, and constraints.

Contributing
I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have a new challenge you'd like to add, please create a new directory for it and include the problem statement, input/output examples, and any relevant constraints.

Please note that all contributions should be made in accordance with the Code of Conduct.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Rust programming community for their valuable resources and contributions to the language. This project is inspired by the many Rust developers who have shared their knowledge and expertise online.
